🛡️ OWASP-Juice-Shop-Privacy-Policy-Challenge
Method: Using-Automation-Tools
🧠 Objective
Automate the process of triggering hidden SPA (Single Page Application) routes to solve the Privacy Policy challenge without user interaction. This method uses browser automation tools (e.g., Playwright, Puppeteer) to navigate, detect DOM rendering, and capture completion states like toast messages or content visibility.

🛠️ Prerequisites
Node.js (v16+)

Automation library: Playwright or Puppeteer

Target Juice Shop instance (running locally or remotely)

Basic scripting knowledge (JavaScript)

⚙️ Strategy Overview
Launch headless browser.

Navigate to the hidden Angular route:

shell
Copy
Edit
/#/privacy-security/privacy-policy
Wait for the DOM content (e.g., <mat-card> or page header) to load.

Detect toast notification.

Take a screenshot and save an HTML report for proof-of-solve.

🚀 Execution Steps
Install Playwright

Edit
npm init -y
npm install playwright
Run the Automation

bash
Copy

🧯 Mitigation Techniques
Use Angular CanActivate guards to prevent unauthorized route rendering.

Protect routes with token/session validation even on the frontend.

Monitor browser automation patterns (e.g., headless headers or navigation anomalies).

🤖 Next-Level Ideas
Integrate with CI tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

Add Lighthouse performance scan on the same route

Combine with BurpSuite to capture HTTP-layer traffic while automating
