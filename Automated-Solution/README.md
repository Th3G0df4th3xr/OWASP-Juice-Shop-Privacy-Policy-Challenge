# Automated Solution - Privacy Policy Challenge

## Objective
Programmatically solve the Privacy Policy challenge using browser automation with tools like **Puppeteer** or **Selenium** to simulate user interaction and trigger the target route.

## Technical Explanation

- **Headless Browser Automation**: Tools like Puppeteer (Node.js) or Selenium (multi-language) can control browsers to perform clicks, input, and navigation programmatically.
- **Route Triggering**: Automation scripts simulate a real user clicking the Privacy Policy link, causing Angular to route to `/#/privacy-security/privacy-policy`.
- **Challenge Resolution**: Just like manual navigation, when the route is triggered, Juice Shop's backend marks the challenge as completed.

## Why Use This
- Useful for solving challenges in CI pipelines.
- Allows you to simulate real users for security automation or testing.

## Environment

- Node.js + Puppeteer installed  
  OR  
- Python + Selenium + ChromeDriver
