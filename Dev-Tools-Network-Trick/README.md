# 🛡️ OWASP-Juice-Shop-Privacy-Policy-Challenge

## Method: `Dev-Tools-Network-Trick`

### 🧠 Objective

Gain unauthorized access to the `/privacy-security/privacy-policy` endpoint using browser-native developer tools and analyze the network-level communications to bypass standard navigation workflows and trigger hidden application logic.

---

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

* Web Browser with DevTools support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
* Basic understanding of HTTP requests/responses
* Familiarity with client-side rendering (CSR) and Single Page Applications (SPA)
* Juice Shop instance running locally or remotely

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ Exploitation Methodology

#### Step 1: Open DevTools

* Launch browser DevTools via `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`
* Navigate to the `Network` tab to capture all XHR/fetch API calls

#### Step 2: Trigger Navigation Logic

* Refresh the page and observe any route-based API requests.
* Search for calls containing `privacy-policy` or inspect internal routing using `main.js` or `routes.js` if available.

#### Step 3: Direct Endpoint Access

* Manually simulate navigation to `/#/privacy-security/privacy-policy` via `console`:

  ```js
  window.location.href = '/#/privacy-security/privacy-policy';
  ```

#### Step 4: Trigger Client Logic

* Once on the target route, inspect the console for toast messages or component rendering logs.
* Look for the message: `Privacy Policy page loaded...`

#### Step 5: Validate Challenge Completion

* Confirm the presence of the Privacy Policy content in the DOM.
* Juice Shop will show a toast: ✅ *"Challenge solved"*

### 🧬 Technical Insight

This method exploits the SPA behavior of Juice Shop, where route changes are handled client-side without full-page reloads. By manually injecting the navigation path or intercepting routing logic, the hidden page is revealed without user-facing links. It also demonstrates how developers unintentionally expose routes that can be discovered and abused by monitoring internal API communication or JavaScript route objects.

### 🧯 Mitigation Recommendation

* Implement proper route-level authentication checks both client-side and server-side.
* Obfuscate or protect sensitive internal routes.
* Monitor unauthorized direct route access via Web Application Firewalls (WAF).
